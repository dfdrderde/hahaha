This extra floor will be made entirely of thick wooden panels engineered in Germany and normally assembled by a crew of specialist installers.

    <desc lang="en">Tim Marlow charts the life of Greek artist Domenicos Theotocopolous, dubbed El Greco, one of the most distinctive painters of the 16th century. His work was considered to be ahead of its time - so much so that it was all but ignored for 300 years. El Greco developed a highly individualistic style that eventually proved enormously influential, paving the way for the Baroque and providing the inspiration for 20th-century expressionism(n)</desc>

They include Worcester woman Susanne, who gave up work eight months ago due to a heart problem and now claims £1,600 a month. Eager to live the celebrity lifestyle, she drives a £28,000 car and hit the headlines in January after making an unsuccessful claim on a £33million National Lottery ticket. Others featured are Carl from the Isle of Sheppey, who spends most of his time and money at his local pub, and Bradford man Craig, who gave up his job two years ago to be a full-time single dad to his seven-year-old son(n)</desc>

Among the stories highlighted are that of Leslie, whose neighbours began capturing his activities on film, convinced that his trade business was illegal, and Phil, who was assigned a restraining order after his ex-mayor neighbour made recordings that proved he was harassing her. Also featured are two tales in which old friendships were ruined when certain parties resorted to breaching each other's privacy and round-the-clock surveillance(n)</desc>

The kids are amazed to see 250 tonnes of waste being processed each day and they are shocked when they realise they will be expected to join the teams of people going through our waste. Are they all willing to get their own hands dirty to dig out the valuable recycling? And with a very strict boss to report to, how will they cope doing the first day of real work in their lives?(n)</desc>
